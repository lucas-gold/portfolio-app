  "Built during my employment at startup NextGen Kitchens working as the sole developer on a React Native white-label app. Collaborated with others to develop and build a NoSQL backend using Firebase and GCP, and collaborated on a user-friendly database manager in Vue.js. App is cross platform with React Native to allow access on Android & iOS, as well as using react-native-web for Browser support. Uses Square, Stripe, Swift and Adyen APIs. App sends order directly to restaurant POS, updates order status and integrates with Stripe payment API and pinpad readers for in person transactions (kiosk app).", 
  'Little side project I started amidst the pandemic, still plan to finish it one day! Play as a bear in the woods, growing crops while fighting off your farmer neighbour who tries to steal them before you can harvest! Work in progress - built using only native Javascript and the P5.js library.',
  "My portfolio website was built using React. I used framer-motion for animation, bootstrap for styling, and tsparticles for the floating program icons on the 'experience' page. The website is hosted using Firebase."
  ,
  "This project consisted of using Apache Nutch and MongoDB to crawl technology-based websites (i.e. The Verge, Engadget) and store their article's data. The Java program creates an inverted index of all pages crawled and then calculates the weight of each article based on the query terms. Articles that have a higher weight relative to the search terms are displayed first."
  ,
  "This Java program takes a string of letters and astericks and finds the greatest possible number of words that can be created by replacing the astericks with any letter in the alphabet."
  ,
  "This website contains a database of 20 tourist destinations around the world. The user of the website can search for any phrase using natural English and any attraction with matching characteristics will be displayed. AngularJS was used in conjunction with PHP and MySQL."
  ,
  "This program takes a random number of words and sorts them into the smallest possible number of bins based on the condition that no 2 words in the same bin can have a letter in the same spot."
  ,
  "This Java program emulates a basic point of sale system with a some grocery items built in to test. The program also shows nutrition information for the items in the cart."
  ,
  "When given a deck with cards 1-52, this program finds each player's most logical bid in a game of 4-player bridge given the cards they've been assigned. It was done for a class project in both Elixir and Rust."
